Christmas (Old English: Crīstesmæsse, meaning "Christ's Mass") is an annual commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ[XXXXXX][XXXXXX] and a widely observed holiday, celebrated generally on December XXXXXX[XXXXXX][XXXXXX][XXXXXX] by billions of people around the world.
 A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it closes the Advent season and initiates the twelve days of Christmastide.
[XXXXXX] Christmas is a civil holiday in many of the world's nations,[XXXXXX][XXXXXX][XXXXXX] is celebrated by an increasing number of non-Christians,[XXXXXX][XXXXXX][XXXXXX] and is an integral part of the Christmas and holiday season.
The precise year of Jesus' birth, which some historians place between XXXXXX and XXXXXX BC, is unknown.[XXXXXX][XXXXXX] His birth is mentioned in two of the four Canonical Gospels. 
By the early-to-mid XXXXXXth century, the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December XXXXXX,[XXXXXX] a date later adopted in the East.
[XXXXXX][XXXXXX] The date of Christmas may have initially been chosen to correspond with the day exactly nine months after early Christians believed Jesus to have been conceived,[XXXXXX] as well as the date of the southern solstice (i.e., the Roman winter solstice), 
with a sun connection being possible because Christians consider Jesus to be the "Sun of righteousness" prophesied in Malachi XXXXXX:XXXXXX.[XXXXXX][XXXXXX][XXXXXX][XXXXXX][XXXXXX]
The original date of the celebration in Eastern Christianity was January XXXXXX, in connection with Epiphany, and that is still the date of the celebration for the Armenian Apostolic Church and in Armenia, where it is a public holiday. 
As of XXXXXX, there is a difference of XXXXXX days between the modern Gregorian calendar and the older Julian calendar. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December XXXXXX and January XXXXXX on what for the majority of the world is January XXXXXX and January XXXXXX. 
For this reason, Ethiopia, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, the Republic of Macedonia, and the Republic of Moldova celebrate Christmas on what in the Gregorian calendar is January XXXXXX; all the Greek Orthodox Churches celebrate Christmas on December XXXXXX.[citation needed]
The popular celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian and secular themes and origins.[XXXXXX] Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving, Christmas music and caroling, 
an exchange of Christmas cards, church celebrations, a special meal, and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, 
known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore.[XXXXXX] Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.
