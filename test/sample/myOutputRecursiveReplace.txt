YYYYYY (Old English: Crīstesmæsse, meaning "YYYist's Mass") is an annual commemoration of the birth of Jesus YYYist[5][6] and a widely observed holiday, celebrated generally on December 25[2][3][4] by billions of people around the world.
 A feast central to the YYYistian liturgical year, it closes the Advent season and initiates the twelve days of YYYYYYtide.
[7] YYYYYY is a civil holiday in many of the world's nations,[8][9][10] is celebrated by an increasing number of non-YYYistians,[1][11][12] and is an integral part of the YYYYYY and holiday season.
The precise year of Jesus' birth, which some historians place between 7 and 2 BC, is unknown.[13][14] His birth is mentioned in two of the four Canonical Gospels. 
By the early-to-mid 4th century, the Western YYYistian Church had placed YYYYYY on December 25,[15] a date later adopted in the East.
[16][17] The date of YYYYYY may have initially been chosen to correspond with the day exactly nine months after early YYYistians believed Jesus to have been conceived,[18] as well as the date of the southern solstice (i.e., the Roman winter solstice), 
with a sun connection being possible because YYYistians consider Jesus to be the "Sun of righteousness" prophesied in Malachi 4:2.[18][19][20][21][22]
The original date of the celebration in Eastern YYYistianity was January 6, in connection with Epiphany, and that is still the date of the celebration for the Armenian Apostolic Church and in Armenia, where it is a public holiday. 
As of 2012, there is a difference of 13 days between the modern Gregorian calendar and the older Julian calendar. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December 25 and January 6 on what for the majority of the world is January 7 and January 19. 
For this reason, Ethiopia, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, the Republic of Macedonia, and the Republic of Moldova celebrate YYYYYY on what in the Gregorian calendar is January 7; all the Greek Orthodox Churches celebrate YYYYYY on December 25.[citation needed]
The popular celebratory customs associated in various countries with YYYYYY have a mix of pre-YYYistian, YYYistian and secular themes and origins.[23] Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving, YYYYYY music and caroling, 
an exchange of YYYYYY cards, church celebrations, a special meal, and the display of various YYYYYY decorations, including YYYYYY trees, YYYYYY lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, 
known as Santa Claus, Father YYYYYY, Saint Nicholas and YYYistkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the YYYYYY season and have their own body of traditions and lore.[24] Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the YYYYYY festival involve heightened economic activity among both YYYistians and non-YYYistians, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of YYYYYY is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.
