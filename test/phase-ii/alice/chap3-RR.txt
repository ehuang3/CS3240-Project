CHAPTER III. A Cucus-Rce nd  Long Tle

They were indeed  queer-looking prty tht ssemled on  nk--
irds with drggled fers,  nimls with ir fur clinging close
to m, nd ll dripping wet, cross, nd uncomfortle.

The first question of course ws, how to get dry gin: y hd 
consulttion out this, nd fter  few minutes it seemed quite nturl
to  to find herself tlking fmilirly with m, s if she hd
known m ll her life. Indeed, she hd quite  long rgument with 
Lory, who t lst turned sulky, nd would only sy, 'I m older thn
you, nd must know etter'; nd this  would not llow without
knowing how old it ws, nd, s  Lory positively refused to tell its
ge, re ws no more to e sid.

At lst  Mouse, who seemed to e  person of uthority mong m,
clled out, 'Sit down, ll of you, nd listen to me! I'LL soon mke you
dry enough!' They ll st down t once, in  lrge ring, with  Mouse
in  middle.  kept her eyes nxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would ctch  d cold if she did not get dry very soon.

'Ahem!' sid  Mouse with n importnt ir, 're you ll redy? This
is  driest thing I know. Silence ll round, if you plese! "Willim
 Conqueror, whose cuse ws fvoured y  pope, ws soon sumitted
to y  English, who wnted leders, nd hd een of lte much
ccustomed to usurption nd conquest. Edwin nd Morcr,  erls of
Merci nd Northumri--"'

'Ugh!' sid  Lory, with  shiver.

'I eg your prdon!' sid  Mouse, frowning, ut very politely: 'Did
you spek?'

'Not I!' sid  Lory hstily.

'I thought you did,' sid  Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin nd Morcr,
 erls of Merci nd Northumri, declred for him: nd even Stignd,
 ptriotic rchishop of Cnterury, found it dvisle--"'

'Found WHAT?' sid  Duck.

'Found IT,'  Mouse replied rr crossly: 'of course you know wht
"it" mens.'

'I know wht "it" mens well enough, when I find  thing,' sid 
Duck: 'it's generlly  frog or  worm. The question is, wht did 
rchishop find?'

The Mouse did not notice this question, ut hurriedly went on, '"--found
it dvisle to go with Edgr Aling to meet Willim nd offer him 
crown. Willim's conduct t first ws moderte. But  insolence of his
Normns--" How re you getting on now, my der?' it continued, turning
to  s it spoke.

'As wet s ever,' sid  in  melncholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to
dry me t ll.'

'In tht cse,' sid  Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move
tht  meeting djourn, for  immedite doption of more energetic
remedies--'

'Spek English!' sid  Eglet. 'I don't know  mening of hlf
those long words, nd, wht's more, I don't elieve you do eir!' And
 Eglet ent down its hed to hide  smile: some of  or irds
tittered udily.

'Wht I ws going to sy,' sid  Dodo in n offended tone, 'ws, tht
 est thing to get us dry would e  Cucus-rce.'

'Wht IS  Cucus-rce?' sid ; not tht she wnted much to know,
ut  Dodo hd pused s if it thought tht SOMEBODY ought to spek,
nd no one else seemed inclined to sy nything.

'Why,' sid  Dodo, ' est wy to explin it is to do it.' (And, s
you might like to try  thing yourself, some winter dy, I will tell
you how  Dodo mnged it.)

First it mrked out  rce-course, in  sort of circle, (' exct
shpe doesn't mtter,' it sid,) nd n ll  prty were plced
long  course, here nd re. There ws no 'One, two, three, nd
wy,' ut y egn running when y liked, nd left off when y
liked, so tht it ws not esy to know when  rce ws over. However,
when y hd een running hlf n hour or so, nd were quite dry gin,
 Dodo suddenly clled out 'The rce is over!' nd y ll crowded
round it, pnting, nd sking, 'But who hs won?'

This question  Dodo could not nswer without  gret del of thought,
nd it st for  long time with one finger pressed upon its forehed
( position in which you usully see Shkespere, in  pictures
of him), while  rest wited in silence. At lst  Dodo sid,
'EVERYBODY hs won, nd ll must hve prizes.'

'But who is to give  prizes?' quite  chorus of voices sked.

'Why, SHE, of course,' sid  Dodo, pointing to  with one finger;
nd  whole prty t once crowded round her, clling out in  confused
wy, 'Prizes! Prizes!'

 hd no ide wht to do, nd in despir she put her hnd in her
pocket, nd pulled out  ox of comfits, (luckily  slt wter hd
not got into it), nd hnded m round s prizes. There ws exctly one
-piece ll round.

'But she must hve  prize herself, you know,' sid  Mouse.

'Of course,'  Dodo replied very grvely. 'Wht else hve you got in
your pocket?' he went on, turning to .

'Only  thimle,' sid  sdly.

'Hnd it over here,' sid  Dodo.

Then y ll crowded round her once more, while  Dodo solemnly
presented  thimle, sying 'We eg your cceptnce of this elegnt
thimle'; nd, when it hd finished this short speech, y ll cheered.

 thought  whole thing very surd, ut y ll looked so grve
tht she did not dre to lugh; nd, s she could not think of nything
to sy, she simply owed, nd took  thimle, looking s solemn s she
could.

The next thing ws to et  comfits: this cused some noise nd
confusion, s  lrge irds complined tht y could not tste
irs, nd  smll ones choked nd hd to e ptted on  ck.
However, it ws over t lst, nd y st down gin in  ring, nd
egged  Mouse to tell m something more.

'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' sid , 'nd why
it is you hte--C nd D,' she dded in  whisper, hlf frid tht it
would e offended gin.

'Mine is  long nd  sd tle!' sid  Mouse, turning to , nd
sighing.

'It IS  long til, certinly,' sid , looking down with wonder t
 Mouse's til; 'ut why do you cll it sd?' And she kept on puzzling
out it while  Mouse ws speking, so tht her ide of  tle ws
something like this:--

         'Fury sid to 
         mouse, Tht he
        met in 
       house,
     "Let us
      oth go to
       lw: I will
        prosecute
         YOU.--Come,
           I'll tke no
           denil; We
          must hve 
        tril: For
      relly this
     morning I've
    nothing
    to do."
     Sid 
      mouse to 
       cur, "Such
         tril,
         der Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would e
      wsting
      our
      reth."
       "I'll e
        judge, I'll
         e jury,"
            Sid
         cunning
          old Fury:
          "I'll
          try 
            whole
            cuse,
              nd
           condemn
           you
          to
           deth."'


'You re not ttending!' sid  Mouse to  severely. 'Wht re you
thinking of?'

'I eg your prdon,' sid  very humly: 'you hd got to  fifth
end, I think?'

'I hd NOT!' cried  Mouse, shrply nd very ngrily.

'A knot!' sid , lwys redy to mke herself useful, nd looking
nxiously out her. 'Oh, do let me help to undo it!'

'I shll do nothing of  sort,' sid  Mouse, getting up nd wlking
wy. 'You insult me y tlking such nonsense!'

'I didn't men it!' pleded poor . 'But you're so esily offended,
you know!'

The Mouse only growled in reply.

'Plese come ck nd finish your story!'  clled fter it; nd 
ors ll joined in chorus, 'Yes, plese do!' ut  Mouse only shook
its hed imptiently, nd wlked  little quicker.

'Wht  pity it wouldn't sty!' sighed  Lory, s soon s it ws quite
out of sight; nd n old Cr took  opportunity of sying to her
dughter 'Ah, my der! Let this e  lesson to you never to lose
YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, M!' sid  young Cr,  little
snppishly. 'You're enough to try  ptience of n oyster!'

'I wish I hd our Dinh here, I know I do!' sid  loud, ddressing
noody in prticulr. 'She'd soon fetch it ck!'

'And who is Dinh, if I might venture to sk  question?' sid 
Lory.

 replied egerly, for she ws lwys redy to tlk out her pet:
'Dinh's our ct. And she's such  cpitl one for ctching mice you
cn't think! And oh, I wish you could see her fter  irds! Why,
she'll et  little ird s soon s look t it!'

This speech cused  remrkle senstion mong  prty. Some of 
irds hurried off t once: one old Mgpie egn wrpping itself up very
crefully, remrking, 'I relly must e getting home;  night-ir
doesn't suit my throt!' nd  Cnry clled out in  tremling voice to
its children, 'Come wy, my ders! It's high time you were ll in ed!'
On vrious pretexts y ll moved off, nd  ws soon left lone.

'I wish I hdn't mentioned Dinh!' she sid to herself in  melncholy
tone. 'Noody seems to like her, down here, nd I'm sure she's  est
ct in  world! Oh, my der Dinh! I wonder if I shll ever see you
ny more!' And here poor  egn to cry gin, for she felt very
lonely nd low-spirited. In  little while, however, she gin herd
 little pttering of footsteps in  distnce, nd she looked up
egerly, hlf hoping tht  Mouse hd chnged his mind, nd ws coming
ck to finish his story.
